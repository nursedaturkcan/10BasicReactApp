# Random Number Generator


This project is a React application that allows the user to generate a random number within a specified range. Here is a summary of its functionality:

1. The user interface is designed with two input fields (Min and Max) and a button.
2. Separate states (minVal and maxVal) are defined for the Min and Max values, with initial values set to 0 and 10 respectively.
3. The randomNum state is used to store the generated random number, with an initial value of 5.
4. As the user modifies the Min and Max values, the corresponding states are updated.
5. The giveRandomNumber function is triggered when the button is clicked. It generates a random number within the range specified by minVal and maxVal, and updates the randomNum state.
6. A section is provided to display the generated random number to the user.
7. The input fields are bound to their respective states using the value attribute, allowing the user to input values.
8. Changes in the input fields are detected using the onChange event, and the corresponding states are updated accordingly.
9. The user interface is constructed using JSX and returned using the return statement.
10. Finally, the App component is exported to make it accessible.

This project provides a simple user interface for the user to obtain a random number within a desired range.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
