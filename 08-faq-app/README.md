# Accordion FAQ App
This project represents a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) app. The app displays several questions and their corresponding answers, with the ability to expand and collapse each question. When a user clicks on a question, its answer expands while the answers of other questions collapse.

The main component of the app is the `App` component. It uses the `useState` hook to manage a state variable called `active`. The `active` state represents which question's answer is currently open. Then, it utilizes the `Accordion` component to display each question and answer. The `Accordion` component takes three props: `title`, `active`, and `setActive`. `title` represents the title of the question, while `active` and `setActive` represent the state and the function to update the state, respectively.

The `Accordion` component consists of a `div` that contains the title and the corresponding answer. The title is displayed along with a `span` tag that triggers the opening and closing of the answer upon user click. The `active` state is compared with the `active` prop of each `Accordion` component, and if they match, the corresponding answer expands.

In this way, users can click on any question's title in the app to view and collapse the answers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
