# Slider Carousel App
Sure! Here's the explanation of the project:

This project aims to create a slider component using React. The basic structure of the project is as follows:

1. First, the package named `react-slick` is imported. This package is used to create the slider component. The related CSS files are also imported.

2. There is an array called `dataLcdp` which contains the data for the project. Each data item represents the content of a card. The data includes the title, description, and image URL for each card.

3. The `App` component is the main component of the project. It contains the `Slider` component. The `Slider` component is passed a settings object to customize its behavior. These settings control the appearance, number of slides, and scrolling behavior of the slider.

4. The `dataLcdp` array is looped over using the `.map()` function to create a card for each data item. The content of each card is dynamically generated based on the data item. The title, description, and image of the card are filled with the corresponding values from the data item.

5. Finally, the created cards are placed inside the `Slider` component. The `Slider` component is adjusted based on the settings object and creates a scrollable slide show on the page.

In this project, the `Slider` component is used to dynamically display the data in a scrollable manner. Users can navigate through different cards by sliding them.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
